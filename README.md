The application consists of a single screen displaying a list of currencies and their exchange rates relative to each other.

By tapping on a list item the user adds the exchange rate to favorites if it was not previously added. When tapping on a favorited exchange rate again it is removed from the favorites.

The application can operate both online and offline. The exchange rates are updated daily when online. If the user uses the application offline the last viewed data will be displayed.

The purpose of the application is to monitor the current exchange rate and highlight important ones for the user.
